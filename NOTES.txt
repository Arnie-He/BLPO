Done:
1. Corrected hvp gradient and mixed-partial, and jnp.mean(...dot).
2. Small networks on Catch and cartpole helped invertibility.
    1- Never had issue with cg on catch (doesn't diverge)
    2- It diverges on cartpole (gradient being nans)
3. Clipping helped a lot, but still only to a similar performance of normal actor critic's.
